I'm a Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer based in London.

Following an **MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning** at [**@UCL**](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/data-science-and-machine-learning-msc), I joined [**@Pontikos Lab**](https://github.com/pontikos-lab) as a **Research Assistant**, where I focus on Computer Vision and Synthetic Data Generation. Previously, I spent three years in **Data Science within Wealth Management** and interned at [**@Imagination Technologies**](https://github.com/imaginationtech)

I am fascinated by Computer Vision, Generative Models, and Self-Supervised Learning. I am particularly interested in Synthetic Data and the emerging field of World Models for real-world applications, ranging from autonomous systems to Embodied AI.

Outside of ML research, I’m a fan of Basketball, MotoGP, video games, and hiking. These passions often serve as the testing grounds for my personal projects.
