I'm a **Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer** based in London.

Following an **MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning** at [**@UCL**](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/data-science-and-machine-learning-msc), I joined [**@Pontikos Lab**](https://github.com/pontikos-lab) as a **Research Assistant**, where I focus on Computer Vision and Synthetic Data Generation. Previously, I spent three years in **Data Science within Wealth Management** and interned at [**@Imagination Technologies**](https://github.com/imaginationtech)

I am fascinated by **Computer Vision**, **Generative Models**, and **Self-Supervised Learning**. I am particularly interested in **Synthetic Data** and the emerging field of **World Models** for real-world applications, ranging from autonomous systems to Embodied AI.

Outside of ML research, I’m a fan of Basketball, MotoGP, video games, and hiking. These passions often serve as the testing grounds for my personal projects.

# Featured Projects
- [**MotoReID**](https://github.com/johnamit/motoreid) <br> An end-to-end computer vision pipeline utilizing YOLOv8 and DINOv3 (Vision Transformer) embeddings for high-speed sports re-identification. The system solves for persistent identity tracking across extreme occlusions and motion blur.
- [**SiT FAF Generation**](https://github.com/johnamit/sit-faf-generate-edit) <br> A generative modeling framework for synthetic medical image synthesis, inversion, and semantic editing using Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT). It enables conditional generation based on genetic mutations and patient age.
- [**Semantic Context Tokens**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f_bSPjfhiGOoaf3Gu1gnbcc2W1wNWSec/view?usp=drive_link) <br> Developed a coarse-to-fine tokenization pipeline integrating semantic tokens with subword units to enhance LLM narrative coherence. Inspired by Meta’s Large Concept Model, this approach yielded significant gains in long-form story generation.
- [**Steven Medical Copilot**](https://github.com/johnamit/steven-elevenlabsxa16z-hackathon) <br> A medical voice assistant prototyped for the ElevenLabs x a16z AI Agent Hackathon. It leverages NLP and conversational AI to automate clinical documentation and referral letter composition.

Other notable projects include [**Contra-CTGAN**](https://github.com/johnamit/contra-ctgan) and [**WeakTR Refinery**](https://github.com/johnamit/weaktr-refinery).
